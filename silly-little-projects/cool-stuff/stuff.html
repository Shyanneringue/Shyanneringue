# Texting functionality
def send_message(sender, recipient, message):
    # Add your texting code here
    pass

# Main program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Get user input for login
    username = input("Enter your username: ")
    password = input("Enter your password: ")

    # Call the login function
    login(username, password)

    # Get user input for sending a message
    sender = input("Enter your username: ")
    recipient = input("Enter the recipient's username: ")
    message = input("Enter your message: ")

    # Call the send_message function
    send_message(sender, recipient, message)
```

In this example, the code is organized into three parts: the login functionality, the texting functionality, and the main program. The login functionality is implemented in the `login` function, the texting functionality is implemented in the `send_message` function, and the main program prompts the user for input and calls the appropriate functions.

You can add your specific code logic inside the `login` and `send_message` functions. Let me know if you need any further assistance or have any questions!
